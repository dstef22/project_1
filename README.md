Final Project 1: Calculator.
        From lab 03 I am creating a gui to use the basic formulas.
        I am adding the new formulas power, percentage, plus/minus, and factorial.
        I am adding formulas to approximate for sin, cos, and e.
        I am adding a function to backspace and one to clear.
        I am adding a function to save answers to a csv file?
        I am adding a function to calculate the square root?
